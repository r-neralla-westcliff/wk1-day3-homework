          | Was amazing! My Walmart didn&rsquo;t have coriander in stock and didn&rsquo;t have ground cumin. I used serrano instead of jalape&ntilde;o. It was just like my favorite tortilla soup from BJs. I am sending this recipe to my family. I want everyone to try it!

          | I just made this soup today and it&rsquo;s so tasty! didn&rsquo;t have corn at home but still turned out very good.  It&rsquo;s a winner!  I made beef chili for my parents; but since my dad has gout he can&rsquo;t eat beef; this white chicken chili is perfect for him.  Thank you Lisa!

          | I LOVE this White Chicken Chili! You are right, it is satiating meal&mdash;delicious with toasted bread. Refreshingly different taste than any chicken chili I&rsquo;ve made in the past. I made it exactly as written and added some chopped zucchini, carrots, and celery. Instead of shredding the chicken, I chopped it into small pieces. It freezes very well. Will be an all-time favorite, for sure.

          | This recipe is dynamite! My partner usually won&rsquo;t eat beans but he finished the whole pot (darn was hoping to have some for leftovers haha). This is crowd-pleaser that I am going to add to my regular recipe rotation. Thanks so much, Lisa!
